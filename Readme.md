Pure Javascript Web Scraper
---------------------------

"Cannot be done from javascript..." 

The key is to run the script as an  Windows HTA Application instead of using the browser. Download the scraper file to your Windows desktop and double-click it  to run the scraper. The file is an ordinary html file with a hta file extension. You may open in in Notepad and inspect it before running the file.
